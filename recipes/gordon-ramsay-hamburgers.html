    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is simple and rustic, ya? We take an American calssic--the hamburger--and baste it in the most fattening substances to add that extra burst of flavor.</p>
    <p>This recipe is perfect for a long night of drinking with the lads, or the basic evening in with the wife. Here's how it's done:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg ground beef</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>One stick of butter for basting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all of the ingredients (save the butter) in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients well.</li>
        <li>Form six balls of ground beef from the mixture.</li>
        <li>Melt and clarify the butter.</li>
        <li>Form patties from the balls of ground beef.</li>
        <li>Throw the patties into a frying pan over high heat. Cook until internal temp reaches 80 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Baste the burgers in butter. Serve on a brioche bun, with horseradish, a leaf of romaine lettuce, and one thick slice each of fresh tomato and white onion.</li>
    </ol>
